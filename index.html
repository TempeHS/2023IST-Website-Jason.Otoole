	  <h3>The Dangers of Bad Mental Health</h3>
	  <p class="fs-5">Mental health problems like anxiety and depression have been linked to an increased risk of physical ailments like heart disease, stroke, and cancer. And even if you don’t have a mental health problem, it can still worsen existing physical health problems. </p>
	  <p class="fs-5">Mental health problems can lead to substance abuse for a variety of reasons. People may turn to drugs or alcohol as a way to self-medicate their symptoms. Additionally, mental health and substance abuse disorders often co-occur, which can make treating both conditions more difficult.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">Mental health problems can lead to communication difficulties, which in turn can strain relationships. People with depression may withdraw from social interaction, refusing to communicate with loved ones. People with anxiety disorders may avoid social situations due to fear of having a panic attack. Additionally, mental health problems can lead to difficulty in trusting people, which can make it difficult to maintain close relationships.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">Mental health problems can have a significant impact on a person’s ability to work. For example, someone with depression may have difficulty concentrating or keeping up with the demands of their job.</p>

	  <h3>How to Actively Improve Your Mental Health</h3>
	  <p class="fs-5">1. Set up a getaway. It could be camping with friends or a trip to the tropics. The act of planning a vacation and having something to look forward to can boost your overall happiness for up to 8 weeks!</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">2. "You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step." - Martin Luther King, Jr. Think of something in your life you want to improve, and figure out what you can do to take a step in the right direction.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">3. Experiment with a new recipe, write a poem, paint or try a Pinterest project. Creative expression and overall well-being are linked.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">4. Show some love to someone in your life. Close, quality, relationships are key for a happy, healthy life.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">5. Take time to laugh. Hang out with a funny friend, watch a comedy or check out cute videos online. Laughter helps reduce anxiety.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">6. Go off the grid. Leave your smart phone at home for a day and disconnect from constant emails, alerts, and other interruptions. Spend time doing something fun with someone face-to-face.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">7. Relax in a warm bath once a week. Try adding Epsom salts to soothe aches and pains and help boost magnesium levels, which can be depleted by stress.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">8. Spend some time with a furry friend. Time with animals lowers the stress hormone - cortisol, and boosts oxytocin - which stimulates feelings of happiness. If you don’t have a pet, hang out with a friend who does or volunteer at a shelter.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">9. “What lies before us and what lies behind us are small matters compared to what lies within us. And when you bring what is within out into the world, miracles happen.” - Henry David Thoreau. Practice mindfulness by staying "in the present."</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">10. Be a tourist in your own town. Often times people only explore attractions on trips, but you may be surprised what cool things are in your own backyard.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">11. Do something with friends and family - have a cookout, go to a park, or play a game. People are 12 times more likely to feel happy on days that they spend 6-7 hours with friends and family.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">12. Take 30 minutes to go for a walk in nature - it could be a stroll through a park, or a hike in the woods. Research shows that being in nature can increase energy levels, reduce depression and boost well-being.</p>
	  <p class="fs-5">13. "Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new." -Albert Einstein. Try something outside of your comfort zone to make room for adventure and excitement in your life.</p>

		<h3>How to Passively Improve Your Mental Health</h3>
		
		<p class="fs-5">1. Feeling stressed? Smile. It may not be the easiest thing to do, but smiling can help to lower your heart rate and calm you down.</p>
		<p class="fs-5">2. Work some omega-3 fatty acids into your diet–they are linked to decreased rates of depression and schizophrenia among their many benefits. Fish oil supplements work, but eating your omega-3s in foods like wild salmon, flaxseeds or walnuts also helps build healthy gut bacteria.</p>
		<p class="fs-5">3. Go ahead and yawn. Studies suggest that yawning helps cool the brain and improves alertness and mental efficiency.</p>
		<p class="fs-5">4. Dance around while you do your housework. Not only will you get chores done, but dancing reduces levels of cortisol (the stress hormone), and increases endorphins (the body's "feel-good" chemicals).</p>
		<p class="fs-5">5. Show some love to someone in your life. Close, quality, relationships are key for a happy, healthy life.</p>
		<p class="fs-5">6. Keep it cool for a good night's sleep. The optimal temperature for sleep is between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
		<p class="fs-5">7. Track gratitude and achievement with a journal. Include 3 things you were grateful for and 3 things you were able to accomplish each day.</p>
